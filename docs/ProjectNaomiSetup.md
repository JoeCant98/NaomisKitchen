# Installation and Setup Guide for Project Naomi on Raspberry Pi

**Note:** Before you begin, make sure you have a Raspberry Pi set up with Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS installed.

## Installing and Setting Up Project Naomi on Raspberry Pi

1. **Update Your Raspberry Pi:**

   Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands to ensure your system is up to date:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Naomi requires several dependencies to work correctly. Install them by running:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install python3-pip libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 libatlas-base-dev python3-dev sox portaudio19-dev
   ```

3. **Install Naomi:**

   Install Naomi by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip3 install naomi
   ```

4. **Set Up Naomi:**

   Run the following command to set up Naomi for the first time:

   ```shell
   naomi-setup
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to configure Naomi. This includes setting your preferred wake word (e.g., "Naomi"), configuring audio input/output, and choosing plugins.

5. **Start Naomi:**

   Once the setup is complete, start Naomi with:

   ```shell
   naomi
   ```

   Naomi should now be running on your Raspberry Pi.

## Installing the Recipe Manager Plugin

1. **Create a Plugin Directory:**

   Inside your Naomi installation folder, create a directory for your custom plugins. You can name it `plugins`. Use the following command to create the directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir /path/to/naomi/plugins
   ```

2. **Create the Plugin File:**

   Inside the `plugins` directory, create a Python file for the Recipe Manager Plugin. You can name it, for example, `recipe_plugin.py`. You can create this file using a text editor or terminal-based editors like `nano` or `vim`.

3. **Copy and Paste the Plugin Code:**

   Open the `recipe_plugin.py` file and copy and paste the code for the Recipe Manager Plugin into this file. Make sure to adjust the code as needed, including adding any custom ingredients and recipes.

4. **Save the Plugin File:**

   Save the `recipe_plugin.py` file in the `plugins` directory.

5. **Restart Naomi:**

   Restart Naomi to load the new plugin:

   ```shell
   naomi
   ```

## Using the Recipe Manager Plugin

Now that you have the Recipe Manager Plugin installed:

- To add ingredients, use commands like "Add one apple" or "Add two cups of flour."
- To find recipes, ask Naomi "What can I make?"

The Recipe Manager Plugin will help you manage your ingredients and suggest recipes based on what you have available.
